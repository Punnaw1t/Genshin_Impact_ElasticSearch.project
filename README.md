# Genshin_Impact_ElasticSearch.project
This project is for subjects ITCS441_Information Retrieval and Text Mining


This project is a team-based, open-ended exploration into information retrieval and web search. Working in a group of up to five people, you will design and build a prototype system. The project will be evaluated on the novelty of your solution, the quality of your implementation, your analytical thinking, and your presentation (both a written report and an oral presentation). You can't use this project for other courses, but you may extend it later to meet other course requirements.


# SCOPE AND IDEAS
You will be implementing a prototype vertical search engine for a particular dataset of your choice.
Your search engine must contain at least the following components:
- Document Collection and Processing
- Document Indexing
- Document Ranking
- Search Interface
